# Linear Regression Model 

This is my practice code in Python for building a linear regression model for the provided data.


#Getting Started

You need to libraries , the dataset and then have to run the model accordingly. It is recommended to use any scientific python dev environment. 
I have used Spyder version 3.1.4
